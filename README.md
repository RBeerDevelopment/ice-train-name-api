First off: this has nothing to do with the despicable ICE agency in the USA.


A list of all German ICE trains run by Deutsche Bahn (DB). 
This API was created since I couldn't find any API or even machine readable file with a list of all ICE trains with name and Baureihe included for each of them.

Data is based on Wikipedia entries for each class (Baureihe) of ICE train, if you find any discrepancies or missing data, please let me know of just create a PR.

Raw data as extracted from Wikipedia can be found in

To install dependencies:
```sh
bun install

To run:
```sh
bun run dev
```
